## Abstract
We introduce a new sketch based interface for generating animations. Unlike traditional digital tools, ours is parameterized entirely by a neural network with no preprogrammed rules or knowledge representations. The capability of our sketching tool to support visual exploration and communication is demonstrated within the context of facial images, though our framework is domain independent. Our recorded sketches serve not only as a means for generating a specific animation, but also a standalone visual encapsulation of an animation's semantic operation which can be reused and refined.
